          <h4>A Day In The Life Of Our Client</h4>
          <img class="aboutimg" src="assets/images/about.png">
          <p>Most of our dedicated teams Are following Agile Development Practices.  They are on the phone multiple times a day with their counterparts at the Client. Remember, they are dedicated teams so our Clients, you, manage them directly.</p>
          <p>Once or twice a week Product and/or Project Managers from our Clients within reach usually drive down to the Tijuana office just 1 mile into Mexico. There they collaborate in real time with their Global Operating Unit located on the 12th floor of the Torre Peninsula Building in the Tijuana Financial and Technology District in the Sonata Services Office. They have 100% access to all meeting rooms and work areas to accommodate full day status and agile/scrum meetings with their teams. Often the teams cross the border into San Diego and other geographies to work from the Client site.</p>
          <p>With our Clients that have the 24/7 development model implemented between the Client site, Mexico, and China, the day typically starts and ends with a US/Canada to Mexico SCRUM meeting around 8 or 9 and ends with a Mexico to China hand off at around 6 in the evening. This continuous development model allows our Clients to substantially increase speed to market on their product deployments and ultimately outpace their competition.</p>
